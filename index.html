  <h1>This is an H1 level heading.</h1>
  <p>This is a <b>header</b>. It is a block-level semantic element that opens a page, article, section, or other segment. Here it is being used as an opening element for the page.</p>
</header>
<section>
  <h2>This is an H2 level heading.</h2>
  <p>This is a <b>section</b>. It is a block-level semantic element that groups together similar content. The article following this paragraph is encapsulated within this section.</p>
  <article class="contain">
    <h3>This is an H3 level heading.</h3>
    <a href="aside.html">
    <aside>
      <h4>This is an H4 level heading.</h4>
      <p>This is an <b>aside</b>. It is a block-level semantic element that may accompany an article or section. Here, it is being used within the article. Asides can be sidebars, inserts, or brief explanations related to the surrounding content.</p>
      <p>It is also worth noting that <b>paragraphs</b> and <b>headings</b> (H1-H6) are block-level semantic elements as well.</p>
    </aside>
    </a>
    <p>This is an <b>article</b>. It is a block-level semantic element for independent, self-contained content. A common example would be an individual blog post.</p>
    <p>As of HTML5, <b>anchors</b> may wrap any level element including block level. This allows entire sections to be links. To demonstrate this, I have made the entire aside element a link.</p>
    <p>The aside is a <b>contained float</b>. If you refer to the <i><a href="stylesheets/main.css">main.css</a></i> for this site, you will see a <i>.contain</i> class which is applied to this article element. This allows the floated aside to be contained within the article parent element.</p>
  </article>
</section>
<footer>
  <h2>This is an H2 level heading.</h2>
  <p>This is a <b>footer</b>. It is a block-level semantic element that closes a page, article, section, or other segment. Here it is being used as a closing element for the page.</p>
